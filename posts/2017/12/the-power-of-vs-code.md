# The power of VS Code

I want to start with a couple of questions...
> Are you using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor? Are you writing  articles to [dev.to](https://dev.to/)? Or are you documenting your work/code with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)? 

I assume that you will answer `yes` to all of my questions above. But...

> Do you know that VS Code has built in support for Markdown?

If your answer is `no` I'll show you a nice tip. I'll reveal a secret. I'm kidding this is not a secret. It's in official  documentation but I haven't read they earlier. If you've created some document and saved it with `*.md` extension you can trigger VS Code to show you live preview of that file. Only what you need to do is to press `Ctrl+Shift+V` and live preview will appear in new tab. In my opinion even more powerful is combination of buttons: `Ctrl+K+V` which end with side-by-side live preview. Now you can work comfortable on your next dev.to article.

Has you known about those shortcuts? If not just try to play with them. I hope this tip will be helpful to you.

### Extras:

- [More about Markdown and VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown)
- __*Notice*__ if combination of `Ctrl+Shift+V` and/or `Ctrl+K+V` doesn't work please check if you saved file with `*.md` extension. Without that preview won't work.

At the end I want to tell you something funny. I want to tell you how I found this nice tip. I'm planning to work more with VS Code so I've printed a VS Code shortcuts cheatsheet. It's laying on my table. Today on during my daily stand up I wanted to eat a mandarin. By the way I know that's naughty. Juice from the fruit smudged paper next to this shortcut so that's the way I found it. It was next to me all the time and I didn't see it. Fortunately accident with mandarins caused that I found it.
