# About me

![Rafał Pieńkowski](/content/images/me.jpg)

I'm a .Net developer specializing in web-based applications. I'm one of Bydgoszcz .Net User Group community leaders. In recent years, I am fascinated by the subject of Domain-Driven Design and software architecture. I'm an advocate of agile software development methodologies combined with DevOps methodologies. A conscious user of Azure and AWS public clouds. Always like to help others sharing his knowledge. Favourite quote:
> "There are no stupid questions, there are only stupid answers."
